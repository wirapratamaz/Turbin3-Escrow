## Overview
This Escrow Program is a smart contract built on Solana using Anchor. It facilitates secure token swaps between users without requiring direct trust. The escrow holds tokens from a maker until a taker fulfills the exchange conditions, at which point the tokens are transferred accordingly. If the taker does not fulfill the agreement, the maker can withdraw the tokens.

## Features
* Secure token escrow using Anchor PDA (Program Derived Address).
* Supports Token 2022 and SPL Token standard.
* Allows deposit and withdrawal of tokens.
* Ensures correct token swaps by verifying mint addresses.

## Deployment Steps
1. Build & Deploy the Program:
```
anchor build
anchor deploy
```
2. Generate IDL:
```
anchor idl parse --file target/idl/escrow.json
```

## Development Progress

### Completed
- ✅ Program structure setup with Anchor
- ✅ Escrow state definition with all required fields
- ✅ Make instruction implemented (create escrow and deposit tokens)
- ✅ Take instruction implemented (fulfill escrow and exchange tokens)
- ✅ Refund instruction implemented (cancel escrow and return tokens)
- ✅ Program built and deployed to local validator
- ✅ Test file structure created

### In Progress
- ⚠️ Fixing test account name mismatches with program IDL
- ⚠️ Addressing stack size exceeded errors in Take instruction
- ⚠️ Resolving test assertion issues in Refund functionality

### Next Steps
- 📝 Complete and fix test suite
- 📝 Add more comprehensive test scenarios
- 📝 Optimize account structures to reduce stack usage
- 📝 Consider adding a frontend interface for the escrow program

## Conclusion
This Escrow Program provides a robust and trustless way to exchange tokens securely on Solana, leveraging Anchor's powerful framework. The core functionality is implemented and working, with some optimizations and testing improvements still needed.
